\ 24c32 I2C 32Kb EEPROM chip single byte write and read.
\ This chip is often found on same small board with DS1307 RTC! ðŸ™‚
\ $50 is the I2C number/address used by my 24c32 32Kb chip 
\ OBS: Some chips, e.g. Atmel, use adr + 1 (51) for Read, and 50 for Write!
\ My chip use same addr. for both read and write!
\ Max addr. for a single byte write/read: 7FFF !
